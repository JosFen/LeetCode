## Algorithms
1. [Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-does-floyds-slow-and-fast-pointers-approach-work/) : Detect loop/cycle in **Linked List** or Find the Duplicate in Array
2. [Boyer–Moore majority vote algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_majority_vote_algorithmw): Find the majority element
3. [Fisher–Yates shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle): randomly reorder an array (which produces an unbiased permutation), the idea is to walk the array in the reverse order and swap each element with a random one before it.
